## Introduction
This repository contains everything you need to augment webcam footage using OpenCV. The program which does this is [aruco_ar.py](https://github.com/armaanpriyadarshan/Augmented-Reality-with-OpenCV/blob/main/aruco_ar.py). However, there's a more to it than just projecting a video into a videostream. The program is built around a printed sheet of paper with 4 markers in each corner. A printable copy of the paper with the markers I used can be found under [printable.png](https://github.com/armaanpriyadarshan/Augmented-Reality-with-OpenCV/blob/main/printable.png). Simply put, the program detects these markers as well as counting rotation and position. Using the 4 corner markers, the program finds the homography and warps mask onto the paper. Overlayed on this mask is the provided video, [Ronaldo.mp4](https://github.com/armaanpriyadarshan/Augmented-Reality-with-OpenCV/blob/main/Ronaldo.mp4) in this case. **Most of the code is referenced from [Adrian Rosenbrock's article](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2021/01/11/opencv-video-augmented-reality/) on the same subject.**

## Organizing our Prequisites and Virtual Environment

Like many of my other projects, this one also uses a virtual environment to avoid version conflicts with previously installed packages on our system. To do so, [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) is, again, my choice. In an Anaconda terminal, run

```
conda create -n opencvar pip python=3.8
```

and then

```
conda activate opencvar
```

Now that we have created and activated our virtual environment, we can install OpenCV_contrib with

```
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

**Note: For this project, I you must use versions 4.3.0+.**
## Drawing ArUco Markers (Optional)

ArUco Markers, standing for Augmented Reality University of Cordoba, are fiducial markers as mentioned earlier, a key step in the process. In the real world, markers can be placed and captured through photo, video, etc. In this project, the corner markers are identified and the encapsulated frame is replaced with a video. 

OpenCV has multiple dictionaries of AruCo Markers built in. I have attached all the markers I used separately, as well as in the printable sheet of paper used. However, if you want, I've also included a [program for drawing new AruCo markers](https://github.com/armaanpriyadarshan/Augmented-Reality-with-OpenCV/blob/main/draw_marker.py). There are a few changes you must make to the script to generate new markers

* **Line 7**: Edit the highlighted value to the ID of the ArUco marker you wish to print.

</p>

* **Line 9**: I'd recommend changing the name of the output file depending on the ID for convencience and identification when you need it. For example, "arucomarker4.png" for ID 4, "arucomarker5.png" for ID 6, etc.

If you plan on using these markers for the AR program, there are a few more changes you need to make

* **Line 91**: Change cornerIds=(1, 2, 4, 3) to the IDs of the ArUco markers you are using. Order should go (Top Left Marker, Top Right Marker, Bottom Right Marker, Bottom Left Marker).

## Augmenting Reality

This step is as simple as running one program. The usage goes as such

```
usage: aruco_ar.py [-h] [--video VIDEO]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --video VIDEO  Path to the video to be projected
```

Just run

```
python aruco_ar.py --video PATH_TO_VIDEO
```

If everything goes to plan, you should see a webcam window open up to which you can hold up the sheet of paper with the markers on it. That means our work is done. If you find something cool, feel free to share it, as others can also learn! And if you have any errors, just raise an issue and I'll be happy to take a look at it. Great work, and until next time, bye!
